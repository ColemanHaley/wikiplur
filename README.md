WikiPlur
========

This project scrapes Wiktionary for noun inflections in languages without complex nominal declension systems. These languages may have inflections for their nouns (e.g., for plurality), but these inflections are not represented in declension tables, and as such are not captured in the Unimorph project; however, certain aims of the Unimorph project, such as morphological inflection learning, may do well to also cover these constructions. Many of these languages are also extemely widely spoken, including English and many Romance languages.

This project is not yet functional, so please do not use this code yet and return at a later date.

This project gets its name from [WikiPron](https://github.com/kylebgorman/wikipron), on which the source code is based.
